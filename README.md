![Payment Methods](charts/03_payment_method_distribution.png)

### What This Shows
Cashless payments (cards, digital wallets) account for **63.1%** of all transactions, while cash represents **39.2%**, and bonus/loyalty points contribute **4.7%**.

### Why This Matters
- **Digital Transformation**: Nearly two-thirds of customers prefer cashless payments, signaling readiness for digital services

## 4. Product Performance

![Top Products](charts/04_top_products_by_revenue.png)

### What This Shows
The top 15 products by revenue range from fresh produce to household items, revealing which specific SKUs drive the most business.

### Why This Matters
- **Inventory Priorities**: These products must never be out of stock—they directly impact revenue
- **Promotional Focus**: High-revenue items are proven customer favorites worthy of featuring in marketing campaigns
- **Pricing Power**: Top sellers may support premium pricing strategies if customers demonstrate low price sensitivity
- **Supplier Negotiations**: High-volume products provide leverage for better wholesale terms and faster delivery commitments

### Business Action
- **Stock Levels**: Maintain 1.5-2x normal inventory for top products to prevent stockouts
- **Shelf Placement**: Position these items prominently at eye level and high-traffic areas
- **Bundling Opportunities**: Create combo deals pairing top sellers with slower-moving items
- **Competitive Monitoring**: Track competitor pricing on these products weekly to maintain price competitiveness

## 5. Customer Shopping Patterns

![Peak Hours](charts/05_peak_shopping_hours.png)

### What This Shows
Customer traffic peaks at **21:00 (9 PM)**, with significant activity throughout evening hours (18:00-22:00). Morning and midday hours show considerably lower traffic.

### Why This Matters
- **Staffing Efficiency**: Current staffing may be misaligned—too many employees during slow hours, too few during peaks
- **Sales Opportunity**: Evening hours represent the best time to engage customers and maximize conversion rates
- **Customer Experience**: Long checkout lines during peak hours can drive customers to competitors
- **Operating Costs**: Stores open during low-traffic hours may not justify the expense

### Business Action
- **Schedule Optimization**: Shift 60-70% of staff to evening hours (18:00-22:00) to match customer demand
- **Promotional Timing**: Launch flash sales and in-store promotions during peak hours for maximum reach
- **Express Checkout**: Add self-service kiosks or express lanes during 21:00 hour to reduce wait times
- **Operating Hours Review**: Consider late opening (10:00 or 11:00) if morning traffic doesn't justify early opening costs

---

## 6. Day-of-Week Performance

![Average Transaction by Day](charts/06_avg_transaction_by_day.png)

### What This Shows
Average transaction values vary by day of week, with certain days showing higher customer spending per visit.

### Why This Matters
- **Weekly Planning**: Some days naturally produce larger basket sizes, indicating different shopping missions (weekly stock-up vs. quick trip)
- **Promotional Calendar**: High-value days offer better ROI for promotional spending since customers are already in a buying mood
- **Staffing Allocation**: Days with higher transaction values may require more product specialists, butchers, or prepared food staff

### Business Action
- **Promotional Schedule**: Run major sales promotions on high-transaction days to maximize revenue per customer
- **Product Launches**: Introduce new products on peak-value days when customers are more receptive to trying new items
- **Staff Training**: Ensure senior staff work high-value days to upsell customers and increase basket size
- **Fresh Product Deliveries**: Schedule perishable deliveries to align with high-spending days

## 7. Store Efficiency Metrics

![Store Performance Comparison](charts/07_store_performance_comparison.png)

### What This Shows
This dual-axis chart compares each store's total revenue (bars) against number of transactions (line), revealing which stores drive high revenue per transaction versus high volume.

### Why This Matters
- **Efficiency vs. Volume**: Some stores succeed through many small transactions, others through fewer large purchases
- **Store Formats**: High transaction value stores may cater to premium customers or bulk shoppers
- **Growth Strategies**: Stores with high volume but low transaction value have upselling opportunities
- **Operational Models**: Different stores may require different operating models (express vs. superstore)

### Business Action
- **Best Practice Sharing**: Study why certain stores achieve higher transaction values and replicate those tactics
- **Format Optimization**: Consider splitting operations into express stores (quick trips) and destination stores (full shopping)
- **Upselling Programs**: Train staff at high-volume/low-value stores on basket-building techniques
- **Real Estate Strategy**: Site selection should match desired transaction profile (premium vs. convenience)

## 8. Price Point Strategy

![Price Distribution](charts/08_price_range_distribution.png)

### What This Shows
Most products cluster in the 1-10 AZN price range, with a long tail of higher-priced items.

### Why This Matters
- **Customer Affordability**: The concentration in lower price points indicates price-sensitive customers
- **Assortment Balance**: Current product mix aligns with mass-market rather than premium positioning
- **Margin Opportunities**: Higher-priced items often carry better profit margins despite lower volume
- **Competitive Positioning**: Product portfolio reveals whether competing on value or premium quality

### Business Action
- **Pricing Strategy**: Maintain competitive pricing in the 1-10 AZN range where most volume occurs
- **Premium Selection**: Expand 20-50 AZN offerings to capture higher-spending customers and improve margins
- **Private Label**: Introduce store-brand alternatives in high-volume price points for better profitability
- **Promotional Mix**: Focus loss leaders in the 1-5 AZN range to drive traffic, protect margins on higher tiers

## 9. Customer Activity Trends

![Monthly Transactions](charts/09_monthly_transaction_count.png)

### What This Shows
Transaction volume varies monthly, indicating periods of high and low customer engagement.

### Why This Matters
- **Market Demand**: High transaction months reflect either seasonal needs, holidays, or successful promotions
- **Capacity Planning**: Low-volume months may not justify full staffing or extended hours
- **Customer Retention**: Declining transactions indicate customers shopping less frequently or switching to competitors
- **Marketing ROI**: Months with naturally high traffic offer better returns on advertising investments

### Business Action
- **Loyalty Programs**: Launch retention campaigns before low-transaction months to maintain customer frequency
- **Event Marketing**: Create shopping events (sales, tastings, demonstrations) during slow months to boost traffic
- **Cost Management**: Reduce variable costs (labor, hours, promotions) during predictably slow periods
- **Competitive Analysis**: Investigate whether low months reflect market-wide patterns or competitive losses

---

## 10. Category Performance

![Category Revenue](charts/10_category_revenue_performance.png)

### What This Shows
Revenue distribution across product categories, revealing which departments drive the most business.

### Why This Matters
- **Floor Plan Optimization**: High-revenue categories deserve more shelf space and prominent placement
- **Buying Power**: Top categories offer negotiating leverage with suppliers for better terms
- **Cross-Selling**: Understanding category relationships enables better product bundling and adjacent placement
- **Margin Management**: Category mix affects overall profitability—some categories move volume while others drive margin

### Business Action
- **Space Allocation**: Assign floor space proportional to revenue contribution, ensuring top categories aren't crowded
- **Category Management**: Appoint category captains to own strategy, merchandising, and promotional planning for top performers
- **Supplier Partnerships**: Develop deeper relationships with key suppliers in top-revenue categories
- **Assortment Review**: Expand selection within high-performing categories, prune underperformers from weak categories
